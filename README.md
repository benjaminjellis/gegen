# gegen

`gegen` is a TUI for finding livescores and fixtures from football competitions around the world. Named after gegenpressing (because it was the first football term that camed to mind when I needed a name), `gegen` is cross platform and should work in most terminals.

## Demo

## Installation

Currently the only way to install is to clone this repo and run 

```
cargo run --release
```

I plan to release via crates.io when the project is more stable as well as providing binarys via github releases.
